**PPM decode library**
===================================

Dear arduino-user,

This is a simple ppm decoder that returns your channel value in percentage. And the best of all: it is all handled by the library! Note: edit some defines for other RC controllers. And finally: sorry for the dutch commenting in the example sketch! 

**Howto use?**
* see included example

**functions** 
* constructor: PPMdecode(short pin, short channels);
* long: channel[i];

I hope that the library is free of bugs. Feel free to comment and/ or adjust bugs or suggest extra functions And remember, respect the GPL2 license. 

When something is useful, give it a star!
